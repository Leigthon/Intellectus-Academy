                <p>
                  Founded with a passion for education, Intellectus Academy began as a small initiative 
                  to help struggling students find their academic footing. Today, we've grown into a 
                  trusted tutoring center serving hundreds of students across KwaZulu-Natal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What started as one-on-one tutoring sessions has evolved into a comprehensive academic 
                  support system, offering specialized tutoring in Mathematics, Physical Sciences, Life 
                  Sciences, and Accounting. Our approach combines expert knowledge with genuine care for 
                  each student's success.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We understand that academic struggles can affect confidence and motivation. That's why 
                  we don't just teach subjects – we build relationships, foster understanding, and create 
                  an environment where students feel safe to ask questions and make mistakes.
